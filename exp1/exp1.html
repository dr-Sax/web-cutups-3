        Hi everyone, if you're hearing my voice now, 
        
        #outline audio.
        that means you have just clicked on the play button in this coding environment that we're going to be using throughout the semester. In this very quick overview, I'm going to give you a sense of what the environment is. And, um, you'll be making one to replace the one you're hearing very shortly. 

        On the left you will see some code. There are several tabs. And on the right you have, what looks like a black screen with three moving images. And what you're seeing on the right is a live instantiation of the code with all three files that exist on the left side in this left tab. If you wanted to pause this audio, and I invite you to do so, you can go ahead and edit any of the text to the left and you'll see that it is updated on the right. 
        
        #outline html and css
        To give you a sense again of what already exists, right now we have an HTML tab, a CSS tab, and then a JS for JavaScript tab as well as what looks like a floppy disk icon and that will be our save function which I'll go through in class. It will come very handy when you're wanting to save the code you've developed at the local specific minute that you want to save the work you've done that already exists at that moment. 
        
        #outline what's in the html
        #fold head #unfold body
        #hightlight TABLE and ROW

        Right now as you're hearing this, you have in the HTML code a small section of a head section that has the title and a link to the CSS style sheet. And then you have a body section which essentially has the table, um. Of the three images and a script that's linking to the experiment one dot JS. 
        
        #outline css
        #switch tab
        If we move over to the CSS tab and you'll notice that the coding environment is synchronized with. This audio that you're hearing so I can click I can ask and synchronize the code to move to the CSS tab. As I am speaking now, so. This CSS has only a few things, like set the background color for the body. Right now it's black. Go ahead and make some changes, make it blue, whatever. You can change some of these numbers. Look at what happens if you change the three pixels you see in line 6 for the table border, or the other one that says TD. What does that do? What can you put instead of solid? What happens if you change the image width in line 14? We'll talk about what you see on line 17 in class. 
        
        #outline javascript
        Let's move over to the JavaScript tab, which you'll see is empty for now. 
        
        #outline saving
        And go ahead and see what happens when you click on Save. 
        
        As I mentioned, we'll go through this in class in much more detail. This was very quick overview. You'll also notice that this page includes chapters and the transcripts of the audio. We'll go through how you can edit and make your own audio and transcript synchronized live coding environment shortly. OK.
